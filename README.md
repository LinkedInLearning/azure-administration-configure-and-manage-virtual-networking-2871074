Learn how to configure and manage virtual networks on Azure. Virtual networks (VNets) connect your virtual machines and other resources, forming the foundation you need to run cloud-based applications. This course provides hands-on coverage of the essential tasks for implementing and managing VNets using either the Azure portal or PowerShell, for quick, command-line control. Instructor Sharon Bennett covers configuring public IP addresses, network interfaces, peering, and Azure DNS. Plus, learn how to create network security groups. This demo-heavy course can also be used as a resource in preparation for the Microsoft Azure Administrator exam (AZ-104).

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.
